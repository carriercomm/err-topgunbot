# TOP GUN BOT

This is a silly chatbot plugin for [Err](http://gbin.github.com/err/) which serves up random lines from the film [TOP GUN](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/).  Commands are available for getting a random quote from various characters in the film.  Send a `!<character-name>` message to the bot to receive a random line from that character.  A list of supported characters can be received by sending the `!help` command.  For instance, sending `!mav` to TOPGUNBOT will return a random line from the Maverick character.

The lines are roughly parsed out of the `topGun.txt` script file which was found laying around on the 'net.  It is not the final revision that the film ended up portraying so some of the lines or character names my seem odd if you are a fan of the film ;)
